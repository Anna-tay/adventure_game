# Overview

This game gave me an oppertunity to learn more about python and arcade. This program showed me how important it is to use build in fucitons to help build a program. In this game you have to find all 11 keys with out dieing. The sprite can jump and more around to collect the keys.

# Development Environment

In this program I used a lot of built in functions to make game play and use easier. I used the camra funciton to make it so I can continue to walk off the screen and the screen will follow. Another one that was extreamly useful was gravity funciton. This allowed me to jump and move to different blocks without falling.

# Future Work

* I want to make the game freeze when the player dies or wins  
* More levels through the door
* Make sprite change when they have the keys
